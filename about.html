                Hi. My name is Leonard, but you can call me Leo. I am so happy
                to see you here. This means that you want to find the answer to
                an important question: “Cine e Leo?” (“Who is Leo?”). Well, this
                is me, on the right. This is me in a studio, surrounded by
                lights, trying, exploring and learning photography. However,
                until recently, I wasn’t like this. Let me start with the
                beginning.
              </p>
              <p class="formatare_text">
                Ever since I was a little child, I used to play with my mother's
                developed film rolls. There were photos of me on those
                negatives, but I didn't know that. I was just inexplicably drawn
                to them. At the age of 7, I received as a birthday present my
                first camera. It was a Nikon Coolpix L21, which I took such good
                care of that it still works, even though more than 13 years have
                passed. With its help I began discovering the world of
                photography and I found it fascinating. Even the most mundane
                thing became much more interesting when it would show up on that
                small screen.
              </p>
              <p class="formatare_text">
                Fast forward a few years, when I was in the eighth grade. At
                that point all my attention was focused on being admitted to a
                computer science high school. I was sure I wanted to be a
                programmer. But what I didn't know was that in 3 years, I would
                rediscover my old passion, photography, through volunteering.
                Thus, in the eleventh grade I dedicated my free time to
                volunteering, photographing as many public events as possible.
                Slowly, it became clearer and clearer to me that I loved
                photography more than anything and that I wanted to dedicate my
                life to it. Even though I attended a computer science high
                school, where I also learned how to make my own website, I
                applied to the University of Arts, the Photography and Video
                department. If until then I thought I knew what photography was,
                what I learned here completely changed my perspective.
              </p>
              <p class="formatare_text">
                Most importantly, I learned that I don't just want to be a
                photographer, I want to be an artist. I am an artist who is in a
                continuous self-discovery. Every day I uncover new facets of
                myself. So, I can't tell you who Leo really is. However, I hope
                you will join me in this adventure and maybe, you will discover
                something new about you, just like I discover about myself
                daily.
