                Hi. My name is Leonard, but you can call me Leo. I am so happy
                to see you here. This means that you want to find an answer for
                an important question: cine e Leo? (who is Leo?). Well, this is
                me. On the right. Me in a studio, sourounded by lights, trying,
                descovering and learning photography. However, i wasn't like
                this until recently. Let my start with the begining.
              </p>
              <p class="formatare_text">
                Since I was little, I used to play with my mother's developed
                film rolls. There were photos of me on those negatives, but I
                didn't know that. I was just drawn to them. At the age of 7 I
                received my birthday present, the first camera. A Nikon Coolpix
                L21, which I took care of so much that it still works, after
                more than 13 years. With his help I began to discover the world
                of photography and it was fascinating. Even the most mundane
                thing became much more interesting in terms of that small
                screen.
              </p>
              <p class="formatare_text">
                Fast forward a few years, I reached the eighth grade, at which
                point all the attention was focused on entering a computer
                science high school. I knew I wanted to be a programmer. But
                what I didn't know is that in 3 years from that moment, I will
                rediscover my old passion, photography, through volunteering.
                Thus, in the eleventh grade I dedicated my free time to
                volunteering, photographing as many public events as possible.
                Slowly it became clearer to me that I love photography more than
                anything and that I want to dedicate my life to it. Even though
                I attended a computer science high school, where, by the way, I
                learned to make my own website, I applied to the University of
                Arts, Photography and Video department. If until then I thought
                I knew what photography was, what I learned here completely
                changed my perspective.
              </p>
              <p class="formatare_text">
                Most importantly, I learned that I don't just want to be a
                photographer, I want to be an artist. I am an artist who is in a
                continuous self-discovery. Every day I discover a new particle
                of myself. So, I can't tell you who Leo really is, but I hope
                you will join me in this adventure and maybe you will discover
                something new in you.
